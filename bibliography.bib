abstract = {The objective of this paper is to analyze the value of energy replacement in the context of demand response. Energy replacement is defined as the possibility of the consumer to choose the most convenient source for providing space heating to a smart building according to a dynamic electricity price. In the proposed setup, heat is provided by conventional electric radiators and a combined heat and power generation system, composed by a fuel cell and an electrolyzer. The energy replacement strategy is formulated using model predictive control and mathematical models of the components involved. Simulations show that the predictive energy replacement strategy reduces the operating costs of the system and is able to provide a larger amount of regulating power to the grid. In the paper, we also develop a novel dynamic model of a PEM fuel cell suitable for micro-grid applications. The model is realized applying a grey-box methodology to the experimental proton exchange membrane fuel cell of the EPFL-DESL micro-grid. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{West2014,
abstract = {This paper presents the results from two real-world trials of an optimised supervisory model predictive control (MPC) system for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) in commercial buildings. The system learns a model from historical data and uses weather forecasts and a given temperature set-point profile to predict building zone conditions and thermal comfort with the aim of optimising building controls for a number of HVAC zones throughout a day. The multi-objective optimisation minimises running cost and CO2 emissions, subject to operator preferences, while constraining occupant thermal discomfort to an acceptable range to find the best zone temperature set-point schedule for the building. This schedule is then applied to the building by a feedback control loop, which balances the power supplied to each zone for heating, cooling and ventilation. A complementary online occupant comfort feedback tool was deployed to all occupant computers in the trial office buildings. This tool allows occupants to submit feedback on their thermal comfort and satisfaction at any point in time via electronic surveys, as well as allowing these surveys to be issued to occupants at scheduled times. This feedback fine-tuned the thermal comfort model used to constrain the optimisation, allowing for errors in the comfort model to be compensated. Thermal comfort feedback was also used to measure and compare relative occupant comfort levels with a baseline. This control system was trialled on two office buildings in Australia, over two winter months and results compared with the performance of the incumbent building management and control system (BMCS). An average energy reduction of 19\% and 32\% was achieved in the two buildings over 51 and 10 days of operation respectively without substantially affecting measured or modelled occupant thermal satisfaction levels. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper presents an application case study of an economic model predictive control (EMPC) method for optimizing the building demand and energy cost under the time-of-use price policy. The control strategy is comprised of an economic objective function that accounts for the combination of energy and demand costs with a time-of-use rate structure, a dynamic thermal process and power model of the building thermal mass dynamics, and a set of constraints to ensure the building is operated properly. The optimization is a min-max optimization problem and is converted to a linear program. The EMPC method is implemented in a commercial office building located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. An internet-based control architecture is developed to carry out tests with the EMPC controller at a remote location. The test results show that the EMPC strategy is capable of shifting the peak demand to off-peak hours and reducing energy costs compared to a baseline case for the building. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Zacekova2014,
abstract = {Modern control methods such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) are getting popular in recent years in many fields of industry. One of the branches that have witnessed great increase of interest in use of the MPC over the last few years is the building climate control area. According to the studies, the energy used in the building sector counts for 20—40\% of the overall energy consumption. Almost half of this amount consists of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) costs which implies that energy con- sumption decrease in this area is one of the most interesting challenges today. Besides enormous potential in reduction of energy consumed by heating, ventilation and air condition- ing (HVAC) systems brought by such controller, it suffers from a bottleneck being the necessity of having a reliable mathematical model of the building at disposal. By finding a mathematical model appropriate for the MPC, it is meant to obtain such a model that is able to predict the behavior of the building suffi- ciently accurately for several hours ahead, which is an especially delicate task. This task is getting even more complicated in case of a real-life application. In this paper, we are looking for a reliable model of a huge three-storey office building in Hasselt, Bel- gium. For parameter estimation, an advanced identification approach is used – its advantage is that it attacks the problem of minimization of multi-step prediction error and in this way, it corresponds to MPC requirements for a good multi-step predictor. Moreover, we discuss not only the identification approach itself but we also focus on accompanying problems with real-operation data acquisition, pro- cessing and special treatment which is an indispensable step for achieving satisfactory identification results. The chosen model is now used in real operation with MPC at Hollandsch Huys.},

abstract = {Building simulation software packages such as EnergyPlus are useful energy modeling tools. These software packages, however, are often not amenable to model-based control due to model complexity or difficulties connecting control algorithms with the software. We present a method for automatically generating input/output data from an EnergyPlus residential home model using the OpenStudio software suite. These input/output data are used to create a simple reduced-order model that can be evaluated in fractions of a second. The reduced-order model is implemented in a model predictive controller to minimize the home's electricity costs during summer months in Austin, Texas, USA. The controller optimally precools the home in the morning and turns down or off the air conditioning system in the afternoon. For this example, electricity prices were taken from actual market prices in the Austin area. The optimal precooling strategy given by the model predictive controller reduces peak energy consumption from the air conditioning unit by an average of 70\% and reduces operating costs by 60\%. Precooling, however, consumes more total energy versus not precooling. Reducing peak energy consumption by 1 kWh results, on average, in an increase of 0.63 kWh in overall energy consumption. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {According to numerous studies, up to 40\% of the total energy is consumed in the building sector. Energy reduction in this sector by means of cost-effective and scalable approaches could have an enormous economic, social and environmental impact. Achievement in substantial energy reduction in buildings may require to rethink the entire processes of design, construction and operation of buildings. As almost half of the energy consumed in this area is used for the heating, ventilation and air conditioning, one possible way to achieve the savings in building sector is to improve the building heating control strategy. A shiny example of the improvement can be the use of model based predictive control (MPC). In this paper, we describe the complete process of the MPC implementation for a real office building in Hasselt, Belgium. Starting with building description and data collection, followed by the discussion about the suitable model structure design and proper identification methods selection, the paper attains to a flexible two-level control concept. Finally, the proposed control scheme leads in average to a 17\% energy consumption reduction compared to the conventional control strategy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The impact of climate warming on Swiss building energy demand was investigated by means of the degree-days method. A procedure to estimate heating degree-days (HDD) and cooling degree-days (CDD) from monthly temperature data was developed, tested and applied to four representative Swiss locations. Past trends were determined from homogenized temperature data for the period 1901-2003. The range of possible future trends for the 21st century was assessed based on 41 regional climate change scenarios derived from 35 simulations with 8 global climate models. During 1901-2003, the HDD were found to have decreased by 11-18{\%}, depending on the threshold temperature (8, 10 or 12 ??C) and location. For the period 1975-2085, the scenario calculations suggested a further decrease between 13{\%} and 87{\%}. For CDD, accelerating positive trends were found during the 20th and 21st centuries. The HDD showed the largest absolute and the CDD the largest relative sensitivity to warming (albeit starting from relatively low levels). Weather data currently used for building design increasingly lead to an overestimation of heating and underestimation of cooling demand in buildings and, thus, require periodic adaptation. Projections were particularly sensitive to the choice of temperature scenario. Nevertheless, they suggest for the next decades significant, seasonally and regionally variable shifts in the energy consumption of Swiss buildings that deserve further study. In particular, greater attention needs to be paid in future to the summer thermal behaviour of buildings. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The approach involves a multiple-regression analysis of historical energy and climate data, and has been applied to eight of the most energy-intensive states, representing 42{\%} of the total annual energy consumption in the United States. Statistical models were developed using two sets of independent variables—primitive variables such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed, and derived variables including cooling degree days, heating degree days, and enthalpy latent days. The advantages and disadvantages of both modeling approaches are discussed in this paper, along with sample results for a combined analysis of residential and commercial consumption in eight states.},

Anecdotal reporting has, by turns, suggested the use of degree-days either works very well, or does not work at all. This ambiguous position is not helpful to energy managers who need robust tools and clear guidance on their use. This paper presents evidence to show how energy/degree-day correlations i.e., building performance lines, can be properly identi" ed, while taking account of the correct (and practical) energy balance of the building. In doing so it shows how the correct building base temperature can be identi" ed from reduced data sets, while demonstrating that such a practice is desirable. Performance lines constructed in this way, where appropriate, give rise to greater accuracy and reliability of results, while forming the basis for improved diagnostics.},

This is being considered as one of main approaches to achieving sustainability in the built environment at relatively low cost and high uptake rates. Although there are a wide range of retrofit technologies readily available, methods to identify the most cost-effective retrofit measures for particular projects is still a major technical challenge. This paper provides a systematic approach to proper selection and identification of the best retrofit options for existing buildings. The generic building retrofit problem and key issues that are involved in building retrofit investment decisions are presented. Major retrofit activities are also briefly discussed, such as energy auditing, building performance assessment, quantification of energy benefits, economic analysis, risk assessment, and measurement and verification (M{\&}V) of energy savings, all of which are essential to the success of a building retrofit project. An overview of the research and development as well as application of the retrofit technologies in existing buildings is also provided.

abstract = {This study assesses the energy savings and cost-effectiveness of individual retrofit options and packages of measures in single-family buildings, based on analysis of metered energy consumption and actual installation costs. We present results for 14 individual shell, heating system, and water heating measures, as well as 21 electric utility weatherization programs. The data on individual retrofit measures represent 32 retrofit projects, ranging in size from three to 30 000 houses. Most of the retrofitted homes are located in cold climates in the United States and use natural gas for space heating. Installation of additional ceiling and wall insulation was quite cost-effective, with normalized annual consumption (NAC) savings ranging between 12-21{\%} in 10 retrofit projects, and average cost of conserved energy (CCE) values between {\$}1.60-6.50/ GJ. Retrofit technique (interior vs. exterior insulation) and basement condition (unconditioned vs. conditioned) strongly influenced the level of energy savings in homes that installed foundation insulation, although payback times were generally quite long. Window replacements were found to have small NAC savings (2-5{\%}) and were not cost-effective (CCE {\textgreater} {\$}15/GJ). Flame retention burners for oil furnaces produced significant savings (19-34 GJ/year for the three studies in our data base) and had CCEs of less than {\$}2.70/GJ. Several retrofit strategies that improve the efficiency of gas furnaces produced annual savings of 7-20 GJ/year (4-14{\%} of the NAC), with CCEs that were comparable to current gas prices ({\$}5-7GJ). Condensing furnace replacements saved 31-41 GJ/year in the three US studies and appear to be marginally cost-effective, even if a worst-case analysis is used that attributes the entire cost of the retrofit to energy efficiency. Data on packages of weatherization measures are drawn from 21 Pacific Northwest electric utility programs. The principal retrofit measures were various types of insulation and water heating retrofits. Median electricity savings were 4020 kWh per year (16{\%} NA savings) with a median CCE of 5.4???/kWh. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {Implementing energy conservation measures in buildings can reduce energy costs and environmental impacts, but such measures cost money to implement so intelligent investment strategies require the ability to quantify the energy savings by comparing actual energy used to how much energy would have been used in absence of the conservation measures (known as the "baseline" energy use). Methods exist for predicting baseline energy use, but a limitation of most statistical methods reported in the literature is inadequate quantification of the uncertainty in baseline energy use predictions. However, estimation of uncertainty is essential for weighing the risks of investing in retrofits. Most commercial buildings have, or soon will have, electricity meters capable of providing data at short time intervals. These data provide new opportunities to quantify uncertainty in baseline predictions, and to do so after shorter measurement durations than are traditionally used. In this paper, we show that uncertainty estimation provides greater measurement and verification (M{\&}V) information and helps to overcome some of the difficulties with deciding how much data is needed to develop baseline models and to confirm energy savings. We also show that cross-validation is an effective method for computing uncertainty. In so doing, we extend a simple regression-based method of predicting energy use using short-interval meter data. We demonstrate the methods by predicting energy use in 17 real commercial buildings. We discuss the benefits of uncertainty estimates which can provide actionable decision making information for investing in energy conservation measures. ?? 2014.},

abstract = {Insufficient energy supply is a problem faced by many countries, and energy efficiency improvement is identified as the quickest and most effective solution to this problem. Many energy efficiency projects are therefore initiated to reach various energy saving targets. These energy saving targets need to be measured and verified, and in many countries such a measurement and verification (M{\&}V) activity is guided by the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP). However, M{\&}V is widely regarded as an inaccurate science: an engineering practice relying heavily on professional judgement. This paper presents a mathematical description of the energy efficiency M{\&}V problem and thus casts into a scientific framework the basic M{\&}V concepts, propositions, techniques and methodologies. For this purpose, a general description of energy system modeling is provided to facilitate the discussion, strict mathematical definitions for baseline and baseline adjustment are given, and the M{\&}V plan development is formulated as an M{\&}V modeling problem. An optimal M{\&}V plan is therefore obtained through solving a calculus of variation, or equivalently, an optimal control problem. This approach provides a fruitful source of research problems by which optimal M{\&}V plans under various practical constraints can be determined. With the aid of linear control system models, this mathematical description also provides sufficient conditions for M{\&}V practitioners to determine which one of the four M{\&}V options in IPMVP should be used in a practical M{\&}V project. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@book{Gelman2013,
abstract = {Now in its third edition, this classic book is widely considered the leading text on Bayesian methods, lauded for its accessible, practical approach to analyzing data and solving research problems. Bayesian Data Analysis, Third Edition continues to take an applied approach to analysis using up-to-date Bayesian methods. The authors—all leaders in the statistics community—introduce basic concepts from a data-analytic perspective before presenting advanced methods. Throughout the text, numerous worked examples drawn from real applications and research emphasize the use of Bayesian inference in practice. New to the Third Edition Four new chapters on nonparametric modeling Coverage of weakly informative priors and boundary-avoiding priors Updated discussion of cross-validation and predictive information criteria Improved convergence monitoring and effective sample size calculations for iterative simulation Presentations of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, variational Bayes, and expectation propagation New and revised software code The book can be used in three different ways. For undergraduate students, it introduces Bayesian inference starting from first principles. For graduate students, the text presents effective current approaches to Bayesian modeling and computation in statistics and related fields. For researchers, it provides an assortment of Bayesian methods in applied statistics. Additional materials, including data sets used in the examples, solutions to selected exercises, and software instructions, are available on the book's web page.},
